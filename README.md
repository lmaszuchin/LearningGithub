#My first Github project
Hello, my name is Louise and I am currently studying to become a full stack engineer.  In the course of my studies I am on the module of learning to use Git and Github.  Therefore my first repository is just a simple html file to learn how to publish to Github Pages.
Thank you for your time in reading this and hope to work collaboratively with you in the future!.
